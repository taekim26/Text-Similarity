Taylor Swift Is Writing and Directing Her First Feature Film for Searchlight Pictures
The “All Too Well” singer is making Hollywood her business.
Prepare for Avatar 3 (Taylor’s Version). Or something like that. After making a steady but noticeable case for Hollywood legitimacy over the years—particularly after the success of her All Too Well short film—Taylor Swift is finally directing her first feature film. Searchlight Pictures is the lucky studio to produce the all-but-guaranteed box-office success, with studio presidents releasing the following statement on Dec. 9: “Taylor is a once in a generation artist and storyteller. It is a genuine joy and privilege to collaborate with her as she embarks on this exciting and new creative journey.”
Not much is known about the project so far—no title or release date have yet to be announced—apart from one key detail: Swift herself has already penned the script. Given that the pop superstar has directed 13 of her own music videos, the All Too Well film, and a 2020 concert documentary, she has plenty of behind-the-scenes experience to work from, not to mention nearly two decades’ worth of songwriting skills to bolster her screenplay.
Her relationships with Hollywood actors and directors including Blake Lively, Selena Gomez, Lena Dunham, Sadie Sink, Dylan O’Brien, and her own boyfriend Joe Alwyn, mean Swift has numerous allies in movie-making—but will it pay off in a true quality feature? And will she star in the film, given her recent small roles in Amsterdam and, notoriously, Cats? Perhaps only in our wildest dreams, but keep your eyes peeled for teases on Swift’s social media in the coming months. She’s never been one to deny her fans a good story.
